# Introduction

The **Heidelberg Center for Digital Humanities (HCDH)** promotes research at the intersection of the humanities and computational sciences.  
Our mission is to explore, develop, and apply **digital methods and infrastructures** that empower research in culture, language, and history.

We collaborate across disciplines to create sustainable, open, and reproducible digital research practices at Heidelberg University and beyond.

This GitHub organization hosts a collection of **research prototypes, corpora, and tools** developed as part of HCDH projects.  
It includes datasets (e.g., *chronorhetorics-corpus*), software prototypes for digital humanities research, and codebases that support computational analysis, visualization, and critical AI applications.  
All repositories are maintained collaboratively by interdisciplinary teams from the HCDH.

# Our projects

## Chronorhetorics

The **Chronorhetorics Project** investigates how political discourse constructs and transforms notions of time across historical and ideological contexts.  
It combines computational linguistics, digital hermeneutics, and corpus-based methods to study temporal rhetoric and its cultural implications.

### Repositories

| Repository name | Description | Repository |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **chronorhetorics-corpus** | A multilingual corpus of political speeches (German & English) curated for the analysis of temporal rhetoric and cultural discourse. Includes structured metadata (date, speaker, source, language) and full-text transcriptions for diachronic and comparative research. | [🔗 GitHub Repo](https://github.com/HCDH-Uni-Heidelberg/chronorhetorics-corpus) |


## CAEDHET

**CAEDHET (Critical AI Engineering, Digital Humanities and Educational Transfer)** is an interdisciplinary working group jointly organized by the **Heidelberg Center for Digital Humanities (HCDH)** and the **Heidelberg School of Education (HSE)**.

It focuses on *critical AI engineering* at the intersection of **AI development**, **digital humanities**, **educational transfer**, and **ethical reflection**.
